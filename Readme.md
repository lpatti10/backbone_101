I want you to spend some time getting use to Backbone and how it works. Specifically spend time with Models & Collections. You also need create at least one view instance.

Set up a Backbone Project
Create a Model & Collection Constructor (play around in your console)
Create a Collection instance and add a handful of model instances to your collection
Get used to getting the properties on a specific model as well as setting/updating properties
Take the endpoint I'm providing and preform some simple CRUD operations on it.
Use this endpoint: http://tiy-atl-fe-server.herokuapp.com/collections/{your-name}
Feel free to play around with this one to test out reading/fetching data
Edit & Delete existing models. This data should persist. On your URL, make sure you can:
Create a new object
Read the ones created
Update a property on one
Delete (destroy) one as well.
Create a view instance
Make sure you either set up an element or create one in your View constructor
Render some data to your page
Use an Underscore template to display your collection data to your page.

Bonus: Create an element on your page and play around with adding an event to your view that will delete the model instance you interacted with. We've not specifically talked about how to do this, but Shane showed you some code and it is documented really well in Backbone's documentation.

Also, I will be updating the class resources link with more reading if anyone is interested - http://tiy-atlanta-js.github.io/resources.html

This homework is due Monday morning. Create a project on Github called something like Backbone101 or similar.
